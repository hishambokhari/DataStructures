// Who remembers back to their time in the schoolyard, when girls would take a flower and tear its petals, saying each of the following phrases each time a petal was torn:

// I love you
// a little
// a lot
// passionately
// madly
// not at all
// When the last petal was torn there were cries of excitement, dreams, surging thoughts and emotions.

// Your goal in this kata is to determine which phrase the girls would say for a flower of a given number of petals, where nb_petals > 0.

function howMuchILoveYou(nbPetals) {
  
}

// function testing(actual, expected) {
//   Test.assertEquals(actual, expected)

// Test.describe("howMuchILoveYou",function() {
//   Test.it("Basic tests",function() { 
//       testing(howMuchILoveYou(7),"I love you")
//       testing(howMuchILoveYou(3),"a lot")
//       testing(howMuchILoveYou(6),"not at all")
